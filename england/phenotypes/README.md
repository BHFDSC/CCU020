# Phenotyping algorithms for evaluation of antithrombotic use and COVID-19 outcomes

Electronic health record phenotyping algorithms for defining diseases, medications, lifestyle risk factors, biomarkers and other concepts related to CCU020 and the evaluation of antithrombotic use and COVID-19 outcomes.

You can find more information on the datasets that are used in the CVD-COVID-UK dataset on the
[HDR Gateway](https://web.www.healthdatagateway.org/collection/3975719127757711).

A list of the phenotypes and their corresponding codelists are provided below.

[1] Codelists for individual drugs (e.g. apixaban) were selected from within their relevant drug category (e.g. DOACs). Other medications (e.g. anti-hypertensives) were selected based on high-level BNF chapter as outlined in protocol.   


[2] Codelist for uncontrolled hypertension refers to raw values of systolic blood pressure which was used to estimate individuals passing threshold of >160 mmHg systolic. Labile INR excluded from HAS-BLED due to lack of data availability.
